## Open ILL Data Documentation

This repository includes the raw and analyzed data for our research into the potential impact of the OA Button and Unpaywall on ILL lending and borrowing activities across four academic libraries:  Oregon Health and Science University, Portland State University, University of Portland, and Pacific University.

The raw ILL transactional data for each institution is contained in the **[raw_transactional_data](https://github.com/rchampieux/open_ill_library/tree/master/raw_transaction_data)** folder.

The **[results](https://github.com/rchampieux/open_ill_library/tree/master/results)** folder includes the found document results against each tool's API.

The **[code](https://github.com/rchampieux/open_ill_library/tree/master/code)** folder contains the R code and human readable results summaries.  For a hight level overview of the results across both tools, explore the **[02-ILL-summary.md](https://github.com/rchampieux/open_ill_library/blob/master/code/02-ILL-summary.md)** file.

The project leads presented preliminary results at the 2018 Northwest Interlibrary Loan and Resource Sharing Conference.  A [citable copy](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/) of our presentation is available in PDX Scholar.
